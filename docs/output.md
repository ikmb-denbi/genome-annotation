# Output

## Main output files

* `AllHints.gff`: extrinsic hints file from all evidences. It is always generated when you run the pipeline. Cannot exist before starting the pipeline. Will have another name if you have used `--allHints`. 
* `outdir/Augustus_out.gff`: output as generated by Augustus. It includes the annotated gene models, the extrinsic hints used, the protein sequences and the accuracy of each predicted model. 
* `outdir/Augustus.gff3`: only gene models in GFF3 format.  
* `outdir/Augustus_proteins.fa`: protein sequences of the predicted models.  
* `outdir/Augustus_withFunctions.gff3`: gene models in GFF3 format, including functional annotation and gene names in the 9th column.  
  
## Additional directories
You can also see the output of each intermediate step, which is saved in specific folders inside the output directory. Of special interest are: 

* `outdir/Hints/` 
  * each separate hints file. 
* `outdir/pipeline_info/` 
  * reports on pipeline performance.
