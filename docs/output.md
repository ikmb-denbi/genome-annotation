# Output

## Main output files

* `<OUTDIR>/evidence/hints/merged.hints.gff`
  * extrinsic hints file from all evidences. It is always generated when you run the pipeline and its primary output.  
* `<OUTDIR/annotation/augustus/augustus.merged.out.gff`
  * output as generated by Augustus. It includes the annotated gene models, the extrinsic hints used, the protein sequences and the accuracy of each predicted model. 
* `<OUTDIR>/annotation/augustus/augustus.proteins.fa`
  * protein sequences of the predicted models.  
  
## Additional directories
You can also see the output of each intermediate step, which is saved in specific folders inside the output directory. Of special interest are: 

* `<OUTDIR>/evidence/` 
  * each separate type of evidence and resulting hints file. 
* `<OUTDIR>/pipeline_info/` 
  * reports on pipeline performance.
