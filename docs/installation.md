# NF-hints Installation

To start using the NF-hints pipeline, there are three steps described below:

1. [Install Nextflow](#install-nextflow)
2. [Install the pipeline](#install-the-pipeline)
3. Configure the pipeline
    * [Local installation](configuration/local.md)
    * [Adding your own system](configuration/adding_your_own.md)

## 1) Install NextFlow
Nextflow runs on most POSIX systems (Linux, Mac OSX etc). It can be installed by running the following commands:

```bash
# Make sure that Java v7+ is installed:
java -version

# Install Nextflow
curl -fsSL get.nextflow.io | bash

# Add Nextflow binary to your PATH:
mv nextflow ~/bin/
# OR system-wide installation:
# sudo mv nextflow /usr/local/bin
```

**You need NextFlow version >= 0.24 to run this pipeline.**

See [nextflow.io](https://www.nextflow.io/) and [NGI-NextflowDocs](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/NGI-NextflowDocs) for further instructions on how to install and configure Nextflow.

## 2) Install the Pipeline
This pipeline itself needs no installation - NextFlow will automatically fetch it from GitHub if `NF-hints` is specified as the pipeline name.

### Offline use

If you need to run the pipeline on a system with no internet connection, you will need to download the files yourself from GitHub and run them directly:

```bash
wget https://github.com/NF-hints/archive/master.zip
unzip master.zip -d /my-pipelines/
cd /my_data/
nextflow run /my-pipelines/NF-hints-master
```

To stop nextflow from looking for updates online, you can tell it to run in offline mode by specifying the following environment variable in your ~/.bashrc file:

```bash
export NXF_OFFLINE='TRUE'
```
