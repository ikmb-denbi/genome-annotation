# Genome Annotation - Troubleshooting

## (RNA-seq) Input files not found

If only no file, only one input file , or only read one and not read two is picked up then something is wrong with your input file declaration

1. The path must be enclosed in quotes (`'` or `"`)
2. The path must have at least one `*` wildcard character. This is even if you are only running one paired end sample.
3. When using the pipeline with paired end data, the path must use `{1,2}` or `{R1,R2}` notation to specify read pairs.
4.  If you are running Single end data make sure to specify `--singleEnd`

If the pipeline can't find your files then you will get the following error

```
ERROR ~ Cannot find any reads matching: *{1,2}.fastq.gz
```

Note that if your sample name is "messy" then you have to be very particular with your glob specification. A file name like `L1-1-D-2h_S1_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz` can be difficult enough for a human to read. Specifying `*{1,2}*.gz` wont work give you what you want Whilst `*{R1,R2}*.gz` will.

## Pipeline is very slow

The performance of the pipeline can be tuned in a number of ways. We have observed long run times for highly fragmented genomes or if the number of sequences
in blast and exonerate jobs is chosen too large. 

### Genome assembly 
Your genome assembly should, at most, contain thousands of scaffolds - ideally much less than that. Modern sequencing approaches such as linked-read sequencing
or long reads make this a feasible goal for many organisms. It is also advisable to exclude very short scaffolds (<5kb) from your assembly prior to annotation;
usually these will not contain any useful information but can increase the run time dramatically. 

### Size if evidence data
Another critical factor is of course the amount of sequence data that is used for annotation. Especially
the processing of RNA-seq reads can be very demanding on the compute infrastructure. So as a general recommendation, we suggest to work with "tens of
thousands of proteins", "hundreds of thousands of EST/Transcripts" and "tens of millions of RNA-seq reads".

## Deleting the pipeline work directory takes a very long time

This is a "known" issue with very deep directory trees under linux. The typical command `rm -Rf work` can then take hours, or days to complete. 

As an alternative, try this:

```bash
mkdir -p empty_folder
rsync -a --delete empty_dir/ work/
rm -Rf empty_dir work
```

## Data organization
The pipeline can't take a list of multiple input files - it takes a glob expression. If your input files are scattered in different paths then we recommend that you generate a directory with symlinked files. If running in paired end mode please make sure that your files are sensibly named so that they can be properly paired. See the previous point.

## Extra resources and getting help
If you still have an issue with running the pipeline then feel free to contact us and open an issue here on github.
