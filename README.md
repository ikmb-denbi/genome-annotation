This pipeline can be used to annotate a genome *de novo*. 

### Pipeline main steps  

1. Hints file is generated from all available evidences (proteins, EST and/or RNA-seq reads). 

2. Gene models are predicted using Augustus with the hints file as extrinsic evidence. 

The pipeline runs these three steps by default, but each step can also be skipped by command line parameters. The minimum requirements are a genome file and at least one type of evidence.
